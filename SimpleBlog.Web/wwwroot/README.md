# wwwroot Static Assets

This service now serves the SPA built by Vite from the `dist/` folder. The legacy `index.html` and `app.js` have been removed to reduce complexity.

- Build output: `dist/` (generated by `SimpleBlog.Web/client` via `npm run build`)
- Bootstrap and icons: loaded via CDN in the Vite template
- Custom styles: bundled into `dist/assets/*.css`

If you need to work on the frontend locally:

1. `cd SimpleBlog.Web/client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

To produce a production build:

1. `npm run build` (from `client/`)
2. Build artifacts appear under `wwwroot/dist/`
