# Docker Compose for development with SQLite (no PostgreSQL needed)

services:
  # No database service needed - SQLite is file-based
  # This file is kept for potential future additions like:
  # - Redis cache
  # - RabbitMQ message queue
  # - Elasticsearch for search
  
  # Example: Add Redis cache (uncomment if needed)
  # redis:
  #   image: redis:7-alpine
  #   container_name: simpleblog-redis
  #   restart: unless-stopped
  #   ports:
  #     - "6379:6379"
  #   volumes:
  #     - redis_data:/data
  #   networks:
  #     - simpleblog-network

# volumes:
#   redis_data:
#     driver: local

# networks:
#   simpleblog-network:
#     driver: bridge
